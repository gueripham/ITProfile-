 I am Vietnamese but not Saigonese.
My hometown is Vung Tau city and I have lived in Ho Chi Minh city for 4 years.
Studying in RMIT is about a year and Vietnamese is obviously my mother language
and English is the second language I contact to my teacher and  friends in RMIT University as well

 Introverted character describes me a lot
not only in student life but also surroundings.
Now I have a part-time job at a “030 Cuisine” restaurant as a waitress.
I am trying to balance between two fields,
which requires an organized schedule for me following every single day.
Hence, I do not have extra free time to hang out with friends or go to the movie theater as other students.
Because of this reason, I spend most of my time practising a guitar and connecting with my intuition.

<h3> Interest in IT

<p>
<Honestly I do not have the entire background about IT (Information Technology),
but I am interested in Turtlebot which is an individual and low-cost robot created by Melonee Wise and Tully Foote in 2010.
I took inspiration from high school time that makes me curious about how to write programs for robots.
At the beginning, I felt a little bit confused because of complicated programming.
But when the first command worked, I got addicted and want to acknowledge more about motion sensors.
After 2 months, I had competition with other schools. Although I and my friends lost on that platform,
I felt so proud of myself for getting over my  boundaries.

In my opinion, RMIT is the best university in Vietnam because
the wholefully efficient English environment gets along with the up to date technique systems.
Simply, I transfer OU (Open University) to RMIT University owing to improving my English skill and approach to practical learning methods.

My academic objective is to enlighten my knowledge as much as I can.
Furthermore, it will support my career path in the future and
I hope I have enough necessary soft skills to adapt my work places.
I also hope I have conscientious friendships to get along with me outside school.
