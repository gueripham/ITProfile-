<h1> Welcome to my IT Profile </h1> :tada: :fireworks:

<h2> Personal Information </h2>

       My name is Pham Hoai Mai Trang, s3836323 is my student number and absolutely it is used for my email account   <p><a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#inbox">s3836323@rmit.edu.vn</a> </p>
  My nationality is Vietnamese but I am not Saigonese. Hence, Vietnamese is obviously my mother language and English is the second language
  used for communicating with my teacher and my friends at RMIT campus. I am from Vung Tau city, which is more tranquil than Ho Chi Minh city
  because of the beach.
  It is over one kilometer from Saigon to my hometown and takes an hour and a half to move. I have lived in Ho Chi Minh city for 4 years, 2 years
  in boarding school and 2 years in university, so I supposed that I have a little bit of well-rounded experience not only about student life
  but also about the people's lifestyle . Studying in RMIT is the most risk-taking determination of my life owing to the need to persuade myself
  that it is a worthwhile environment. I can improve myself a lot and chase my dream as a fashion designer despite extravagant tuition fees.

       An introverted character describes me a lot in every relationship. But if this environment requires me to affiliate with teammates,
  I can balance my energy, my mood following specific situations, and after that I will return my original version of myself.
  Now I have a part-time job at a “030 Cuisine” restaurant as a waitress. I am trying to control between two fields, which requires an organized schedule
  for me following every single day. Hence, I do not have extra free time to hang out with friends or go to the movie theater as other students,
  which sometimes make me under pressure for doing my assignments with time allotment. Because of this reason, I spend most of my time practicing guitar
  and connecting with my intuition. The most valuable lesson I remind myself is your value is defined via your enlightenment and your personality in any circumstance.

</p>

<h2> Interest in IT </h2>

<p>
       Honestly, I do not have the entire background about IT (Information Technology), but I am interested in Turtlebot which is a low-cost individual robot
  developed by Melonee Wise and Tully Foote in 2010. I took inspiration from high school when I took part in an automatic technology competition.
  The simple reason for my attendance is I am so curious about how to run a system to make a robot work. About my feelings, in the beginning, I felt
  a little bit confused because of complicated programming. But when the first command worked, I got addicted and want to acknowledge more about motion sensors.
 After practicing for two months, I had a chance to challenge myself as a representative for my school. Although I and my friends lost on that platform,
 I felt so proud of myself for getting over my boundaries.

       Choosing RMIT to study is definitely not my choice because of many excuses including external and internal aspects that I got. One of the reasons
 is the tuition fee, I used to think that school is not an important factor to study, everything will be managed or stimulated depending on your effort.
 For example, some low-performed students have been well-educated and they got sufficient achievements more than a student with good condition.
 RMIT is the best university in Vietnam because the efficient English environment gets along with the up to date technique systems. Simply, I transfer
 OU (Open University) to RMIT University owing to improving my English skill and approach to practical learning methods.

        My academic objective is to enlighten my knowledge as much as I can. Furthermore, it will support my career path in the future and I hope I have enough
 necessary soft skills to adapt to my workplaces. I also hope I have conscientious friendships to get along with me outside school because student life is
 not just about lessons, lecturers or assignments.

<h2> Personal Profile </h2>
<ul>
<li> Myer-Briggs - the first test
      Based on my personality test, INTJ characteristics which are my result make up nearly 3 percent of the population. I prefer to have an observation,
  conscious thought to put ideas into action. I am totally on this result, for instance, coping with issues is a time-consuming action. I need to
  have logical thinking and analysis to combine optimal solutions, then I pick the most positive outcome to desire. Moreover, INTJs - the Versionaries
  have strong connections with their tuition and inner voice insightfully, so most of their decisions depend on it. Many well-known people have INTJ characteristics.
  Placed on Joseph Chris blog, Karl Marx, is a philosopher, he prefers changing the world following his norms. INTJs are not concerned with other people’s judgement,
  they often have creative thinking and it usually works in the future though people said that it is so crazy and unrealistic.</li>

<li> Learning Style Test - the second test
      I can recognize which types of learning styles I am through Personalitymax, which guide me to have more efficient self-study and improve my lack of methods.
  Kinesthetic, which is my dominant learning style, is getting on with practicing experience. I would rather have physical courses than traditional learning methods.
  On the other hand, some subjects are Literature, History, and Geography that I am satisfied with in textbook learning. Auditory is my secondary learning habit,
  sometimes getting concentrated on a lecture makes me distracted from the content. I am able to understand and have connections with the lecturers, but some aspects
  are not acknowledged with high comprehension. For example, this semester I have a Supply Chain Management course, when I hear the lecturer present the information,
  it is around 60 percent of the information I can digest. The solution is practicing calculations exercises as much as I can to put my own interpretation in depth. </li>

<li> Creativity Test - the third test
      The top 3 metrics describe me are connection, boldness and paradox. To start with the first factor, connection is one of my priorities in any project.
  When I hear someone’s stories, I want to link it together to make it smooth and logical or a combination helps me to become an organized-person as well.
  I have the opposite opinion with the second metric, Boldness, I easily break my boundaries to embrace convention, but not at all, I’m being affected
  by the judgment surrounding it. In any situation, I can get along with my teammates well, I usually attempt a reconciliation between the two contrasting sides.
  Therefore, I can work in group activities to have a high-efficient result, but I prefer to work in my own way. </li>

<summary><h3> In conclusion, after doing three online tests, I can recognize and enlighten more about myself I actually can guess what my personality is, which learning styles
  I am truly satisfied with, but all of them are an abstract picture until I have tests. With the result of the first test, Personal Profile, I can affiliate with team
  building activities, I always have a specific plan to follow step by step to avoid late submission. It is a positive behaviour required to have productive work.
  But sometimes I am too stubborn to change my norms, my thoughts and it will have negative effects. </h3> </summary>

<h2> Project Ideas </h2>

<h1> The Same Partner </h1> A Chatterbot System for people with disabilities to communicate with a society network

<h3><sub1> Abstract </sub1></h3>

<p>  It is not surprising that chatbot is a traditional agent as a buddy that helps people interact with other users, share their private stories as well as simply
  want to have someone to talk. Most of the chatbots utilize a keyboard as the input that is an obstacle for the disabled attendances. Along with this concept, chatbot
  will be equipped with some advanced tools such as voice recognition and a three-dimensional avatar to boost their connection. In this paper, I introduce a new version
  of artificial intelligence (AI) software called TheSamePartner chat, which will integrate with special techniques for the disabled and can eliminate isolation and limited
  opportunity in a society. The goal of this project is I want the people with “low-condition” to no longer feel they are marginalized and afraid of communicating with other people.
  I do not deny it is a challenge, but in comparison, it is not fair that people with full functional abilities can not do a favor for the special people. </p>

<h3><sub2> Motivation </sub2></h3>

<p>  Communication is a minimum component of relationships, and online discussion platforms appeal to many people to participate recently. This model does not have any complicated
  requirements, and it is also accessible for everyone to use. Indeed, the European Commission 's position can now be interpreted in terms of a social model “ The EU social model
  of disability stresses the environmental barriers in society which prevent the full participation of people with disabilities in society. These barriers must be removed …”
  (Commission of the European Communities 2003, 4) <p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2010.505749?casa_token=WNCBNZaKIb8AAAAA%3AD8MLqO97K16vbKEs-lPc1EAg8QGBLnQKYUWasW_g0jNhR2I2ZfokQyDcJO_tM66T0_Mq9SnRMGM/"></a> </p>.
  Even if that is a right the disabled can not integrate with civil society fairly. Hence, TheSamePartner, which is a public online-program, guides this group of people sharing their emotion, speaking out their difficulties as a normal person, and natural feel. Their impairment is not being hidden
  because we are the same. More and more organizations will scale-up as they feel comfortable to take part in not only virtual activities but also physical ones. </p>

<h3><sub3> Description </sub3></h3>

<p>   Depending on the Changing Faces Article, there are six types of disabilities, but I carry out the software in limited groups as 3 types such as Physical Disabilities,
  Visual Disabilities, and Hearing Disabilities. The others (Mental Health Disabilities, Learning Disabilities, and Intellectual Disabilities) which request a diversity of analysis
  are clearly complicated projects that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not far away with. TheSamePartner includes two regimens, private version and public platform, the disabled
  might set up features that suit their demands.

       To start with, a private version is a fundamental step that TheSamePartner can approach to users. Each person has different personal bubbles that define their personality
  as well as their behaviors. Personal space is a sensitive world that no one can invade other privacy, especially people with disabilities.Many people assume that the disabled do not have enough capabilities to do hands-on activities.
  It becomes a barrier for people with disabilities to take sufficient opportunities to work, learn and also join social activities.. Because of discrimination, the disabled feel disrespect, disconnected, unaffiliated with society,
  then they tend to be alone, have private bubbles and their communication skills are lost through time. TheSamePartner acts as a friendly friend that people with disabilities can feel free comfortable to share
  their daily stories, emotions, or have a friendship. Moreover, the users’ feeling is a basic criterion for a private version based on and the types of disabilities which are the next element.
  For instance, TheSamePartner can recognize user emotions through their positive or negative conservations, then if a user is a person who has low vision, the chatbot will suggest
  a range of audios or videos to describe peaceful places, beautiful surroundings, or healing talk shows. The purposes of this concept are making the able-bodied people feel they are
  not alone, they obviously can enjoy different activities as a normal person. In addition, they can have a full picture of their surroundings by imagining as well as hearing.
  Thus, the private version is used for the disabled who have personal stories, sensitive to communicate with large groups.

     The next version is public chatbot. It is separated into different topics that the disabled can join in following their interests, hobbies, and abilities. TheSamePartner is
  a virtual environment in which the disabled get easier to share, talk because no one knows each other directly and clearly. If the time, place, perception is adequate, many
  able-bodied people are willing to allow you to engage with their life. Online clubs form part of the diversity present in today's communication, don't they? Understanding
  their own feelings, beliefs, and realizing their values, it is no doubt that unity in a physical environment will pop up and influence the way people think of disabled people
  in a civilized human. The reason why I think it is possible and feasible is when self-inferiority is eliminated, it is time to immerse themselves in a human interaction totally.
  This project closely associate two these environments and each individual has the same equal rights to self-expression. </p>

<h3><sub4> Tools and Technologies </sub4></h3>

<p>    Created a chatbot requires not only hardware but also software tools. Slack, which is an internal tool, provides users with an application programming interface ( API)
  to create applications and automate processes. Many features of the IRC style, chat rooms organized by subject, private groups and personal conservations are offered by Slack.
  Next, user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design, both of them have emerged as crucial roles to an IT product. They also make and provide users to experience better
  and provide highly optimized, simple yet engaging user experience at the same time. As like languages, natural language processing (NLP) service to transfer users' input to guide
  a machine understands the human language that is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). The last tool is Zapier, it can connect to over 1500 apps to have many useful features
  that are suitable for my project idea such as suggesting a video, creating calendar activities. About hardware, it is not surprising that a keyboard seems as core input naturally.
  But this chatbot will be equipped with a three-dimensional avatar and voice recognition via camera and speech recognition technology because of specific purposes for the people with disabilities </p>

<h3><sub5> Skills Required </sub5></h3>

<p>    Well-rounded experience is to design UI / UX: your visual design skills, the ability to use specific software, wireframe creation skills, mockups, interactive prototypes,
  and also some software engineering skills needed to build a chatbot, knowledge of Slack integration process in conjunction with skill to create a backend app, which is able to
  resolve user requests and actions connect with Zapier app to give appropriate suggestions. Besides, general accomplishment is an integral part of deploying chatbots.
  Good understanding and conscientious analysis of users will contribute to your chatbot success mostly.  Moreover, rich experiences will accurately shape your chatbot personality.
  Finally, a chatbot acts as a middleman who connects machines and front-end customer interaction more effectively. </p>

<h3><sub6> Outcome </sub6></h3>

<p>    According to the World Health Organization, over a billion people live with different forms of disabilities that is around 15 percent of the world’s population.
  Thanks to an amazing electronic and information technology innovation, assistive technology has brought about a revolution in possibilities for handicapped people.
  There are so many efficient solutions for learning opportunities, but it is not adequate and equal enough for the people of disabilities to have basic human rights.
  Their entertainment is also important in their daily lives as non-disabled people, so my project idea is a promising development which will change stigma and perception
  to help them feel more fulfilled, self-esteem as well as self-expression. But the obstacle is different people have different situations, the automatic chatbot can not
  meet up with emotional conservations at all, it can be improved by taking as many experiences as possible from user information input.
  Therefore, TheSamePartner - an automatic chatbot is an ideal project for the able-bodied, yet it is never instead of face-to-face communication. </p>
